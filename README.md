# K-Means Clustering

The K-Means clustering algorithm is an extremely simple yet effective method
of establishing (what we hope are) meaningful clusters in an input dataset.

K-Means works best on data which can be grouped into distinct, round, well
separated clusters of datapoints. It should not be used in situations where
data is sparse or the centerpoint of the clusters is not particularly clear.

In this distribution, I have demonstrated the use of K-Means on some image 
data, using the RGB values of each pixel to identify different regions within
the image.
